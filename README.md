A experimental c++ compiler in typescript

online demo => [zurl.github.io/web-cpp](https://zurl.github.io/web-cpp)

# Introduction in brief

This project is a In-browser C++ Compiler and Runtime toolchains,
which requires no server and could run in all major browsers.

Our compiler could compile C++ to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/),
which is a low-level programming language. WebAssembly is supported by most
browsers currently, it is much more faster than JavaScript, and able to be compiled
from all static languages.

[LLVM](http://llvm.org/) provides excellent support of WebAssembly Backend, our
compiler is inspired by them and learned a lot from its good design.

Our Compiler and Runtime is much more fast than all C++ interpreter in browser,
the c++ code will be compiled directly to WebAssembly, and WebAssembly will be
executed by high performance JIT execution engine in our browser. According to our
experiment, our compiler could have nearly same performance to gcc/g++ without
optimization.

## usage

1. build web-cpp compiler itself

```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
```

2. build the web-cpp online ide

we use parcel as our packager, you could use any kind of web packager with your
custom configuration.

```shell
npm run build
cd ide
parcel build index.html
```


## DEMO
use `./cc` as local runtime (Node.js)

```shell
./cc run resource/testcodes/demo.cpp
```

## miscellaneous

This project is my thesis of my bachelor's degree, which is inspired by
the rapid development of online programing education. This project is
targeted to improve the C++ learning experience for new students,
thanks to everyone who helps me in the development of this project.
